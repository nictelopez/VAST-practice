## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS and JavaScript

Using Mobile First, we worked by section, that is, we started with the HTML Header and once finished we continued with the CSS of that part. So with each section of the web page.
A little JavaScript was implemented to create the drop down menu.

## Lessons Learned:

I keep the responsible development learning and the organization of each file to make it easy to read, and in case a change needs to be made to be able to easily locate the parts of the file. 
I also learned about the practice of having reusable styles for the different elements that make up the web page.
